\usage{
FAO_Rn(loc, weather, albedo = 0.23, Gsc = 0.082, SBc = 4.903e-09)
}
\arguments{
\item{loc}{a list with location information that includes:
\itemize{
\item z - elevation above mean sea level (m)
\item phi - latitude (radians). Positive for northern hemisphere, negative
            for southern hemisphere.
\item Lm - longitude of location (degrees west of Greenwich).
\item Lz - longitude of location's timezone (degrees west of Greenwich). For
           example, Lz = 75, 90, 105 and 120째 for the Eastern, Central, Rocky
           Mountain and Pacific time zones (United States) and Lz = 0째 for
           Greenwich, 330째 for Cairo (Egypt), and 255째 for Bangkok (Thailand)
}}

\item{weather}{a list with weather data that includes:
\itemize{
\item dt - string indicating the timestep of input weather series. Expects
           "hourly", "daily", or "monthly".
\item datetimes - datetimes of weather records [POSIXct]. If monthly
                  timestep, make sure date is the 15th of each month.
\item atmp - If hourly timestep, vector of air temperature (degrees C)
           corresponding with datetimes vector. If daily or monthly timestep,
           list with two vectors, "min" and "max", with mean daily min and
           max air temperature (degrees C) corresponding with datetimes
           vector
\item RH - If hourly timestep, vector of relative humidity (percent)
           corresponding with datetimes vector. If daily or monthly timestep,
           list with two vectors, "min" and "max", with mean daily min and
           max relative humidity (percent) corresponding with datetimes
           vector.
\item Rs - vector of incoming solar or shortwave radiation (MJ/m^2/timestep),
           corresponding with datetimes vector.
\item wind - vector with mean windspead (m/s), corresponding with datetimes
             vector.
\item wind_elev - atomic number, height at which wind is measured (m)
}}

\item{albedo}{albedo or canopy reflection coefficient (-). Defaults to 0.23
for the hypothetical grass reference crop.}

\item{Gsc}{solar constant (MJ/m^2/min). Defaults to 0.0820 MJ/m^2/min.}

\item{SBc}{Stefan-Boltzman constant (MJ/m^2/day). Defaults to 4.903e-9
MJ/m^2/day.}

\description{
Calculates the net solar or shortwave radiation for a given location based on
incoming solar radiation timeseries. Based on Equation 38 in Allen et al.
(1998).
