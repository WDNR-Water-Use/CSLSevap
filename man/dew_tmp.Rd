\title{Dew Point Temperature}
\usage{
dew_tmp(atmp, RH)
}
\arguments{
\item{atmp}{air temperature (degrees C). When dt is "daily" or larger,
argument should be a list with elements "min" and "max" for daily
min and max temperatures. When dt is "hourly", argument should be
a vector with hourly recorded temperatures.}

\item{RH}{relative humidity (percent). When dt is "daily" or larger, argument
should be a list with elements "min" and "max" for daily min and
max relative humidities. When dt is "hourly", argument should be a
vector with hourly recorded relative humidities.}
}
\value{
\item{dewtmp}{the dew point temperature (degrees C)}
}
\description{
Calculates the dew point temperature as a function of actual vapour pressure,
based on McJannet et al. (2008) Equation 26 as presented in McMahon et al.
(2013) Equation S2.3
