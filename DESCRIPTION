Description: The package 'CSLSevap' bundles multiple ways of calculating 
    evapo(transpi)ration for use in the Wisconsin Department of Natural 
    Resources Central Sands Lakes Study. Methods include: 1) FAO Penman-Monteith 
    reference evapotranspiration, 2) McJannet lake evaporation, and 3) 
    Unmodified Hamond lake evaporation. For most uses, it is only necessary to 
    interact with the 'evaporation' or 'CSLS_daily_met' functions. However, all 
    functions are made accessible to the user since they may be useful in other 
    contexts (e.g., for calculating saturation vapor pressure, dew point 
    temperature).
