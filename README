# CSLSevap

CSLSevap is an R package containing multiple evaporation functions useful to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Central Sands Lakes Study (CSLS). Included evapo(transpir)ation approaches include:

 * FAO Penman-Monteith Reference Evapotranspiration
 * McJannet lake evaporation
 
## Installation

To install from within the WI DNR (assumes you're using R Studio and are familiar with installing other packages):

 1. Navigate to the CSLSevap package by either:  
    * Opening `CSLSevap.proj` from the CSLSevap folder (Z:\WQWT_PROJECTS\WY_MS_Monitoring\2018 Summer Field Crew\Central Sands Lake Study\Analysis_2019\CSLSevap) (preferred)  
    * Set your working directory to the CSLSevap folder `setwd("Z:/WQWT_PROJECTS/WY_MS_Monitoring/2018 Summer Field Crew/Central Sands Lake Study/Analysis_2019/CSLSevap")`  
    
    **Note:** If you want to be able to knit an Rmd file that is saved within this package, you must have the shared network mapped to a letter drive (e.g., "Z:/" for "//central/water/") and you must open the .proj workspace (or set your working directory) via this letter drive. If you don't, knitting will fail with a less-than-helpful error message (that doesn't mention anything about the letter drive requirement).
 2. While your working directory is set to the top level of `CSLSevap`, use the R package `devtools` to install locally.
    ```R
	install.packages("devtools")
	devtools::install()
	```
